## 🛠️ things to improve

- better cache for patient list (tried to build the SWR caching, but sometimes it's not refreshing correctly and needs to be done manually)

- some UI elements need some more work (like select drop-down menu, checkbox, notification)
    - i used the basic ones already present in standard html, but they are not as modifiable/designable as lets say headlesUI components)
- table could also be made as a proper custom element, since i had problems modifying how styling was applied to the table(e.g. rounded edges, highlighting cells).
